<h3>Information</h3>
<div class="paddedcontent">Length of visit is the average amount of time each user spends on the site, based on the pattern of their browsing and the time between each request.  This can vary a lot depending on the type of information or service offered by the site - most visits tend to be very short because if the user only loads one page it is impossible to tell how long they spent reading it.</div>
