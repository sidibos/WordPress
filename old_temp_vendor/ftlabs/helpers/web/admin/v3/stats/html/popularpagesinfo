<h3>Information</h3>
<div class="paddedcontent">This table shows the most popular pages on the site according to the number of hits they have received, and the data they have transferred.</div>
<div class="paddedcontent">You can use the information here to see which pages are responsible for the majority of your bandwidth requirement, so that if necessary you can take steps to reduce their size.</div>
<div class="paddedcontent">Also listed against each page is the number of entries and exits made on the page.  An <em>entry</em> is a hit that was the user's first request on the site.  Similarly, an <em>exit</em> is a hit that was the user's last request on the site.  This is useful for managing traffic flows through the site - if pages that occur deep within the site are proving to be popular entry pages, adding more links to them can help distribute that traffic across the site, and equally managing the structure of the exit pages can provide the user with other places that they might want to visit rather than leaving the site.  See the <a href="flowmap/">traffic flow map</a> for a graphical view of this.</div>
<div class="paddedcontent">The data excludes any requests to binary files (eg images) and anything in the '/lib/' directory.</div>
