<h3>Information</h3>
<div class="paddedcontent">A <strong>hit</strong> is a request by a user's browser for a file on the server.  This includes images, styles, and javascript as well as pages, and if the same person views the same page twice, it's counted twice.</div>
<div class="paddedcontent">The <strong>pages</strong> figure filters out requests for binary file such as images, and only counts one visit by one user to one page.  If a person visits page A twice, it is only counted once.  However, if they visit pages A and B, that's counted as two pages.</div>
<div class="paddedcontent"><strong>Visitors</strong> goes further and counts only pages requested by unique users.  So if the user views every page on the site, downloading countless PDFs, images and styles in the process, they might generate masses of <em>pages</em> and an enormous number of <em>hits</em>, but only register as one <em>visitor</em>.</div>
<div class="paddedcontent"><strong>Data</strong> is quite simply the amount of data that is sent from the server to all the users who have visited the site in the specified period.  This may be important if you are near a bandwidth limit or are already paying excess bandwidth charges.</div>
