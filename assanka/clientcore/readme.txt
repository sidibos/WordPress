This directory is empty within this module, but is populated as a deploy destination by other modules, which should create directories in the form coreXXXXX where XXXXX is the client code of the client whose core libraries that module contains, and also the name of the VCS module.  At time of last update of this readme, we have only one of these, for the FT, which is called coreftco.
