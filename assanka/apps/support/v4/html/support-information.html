<p>Requesting support from Assanka is simple, and we aim to resolve any faults as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>When submitting a support request, we'll ask you for some basic details which are explained in more detail on the form itself.  It is then entered into our support database with a status of <em><b>new</b></em>.  Within the period specified in your support agreement, an engineer will review your request, classify it, and assign it to someone who can deal with it.</p>
<p>When the request is classified, it is usually assigned to a engineer at the same time.  The status is then changed to <em><strong>assigned</strong></em>.  The engineer will work on the issue until either we need information from you in order to continue, you ask us to stop, or the issue is concluded.</p>
<p>If we need information from you in order to continue, a request may be placed in a <em><strong>awaiting client</strong></em> state.  If, in consultation with you, we decide to monitor the system for some time before taking action on the issue, or if a request is prioritised to a later development stage, it may be placed in a <em><strong>deferred</strong></em> state.</p>
<p>When the issue is concluded, the engineer assigned to it will set the status to <em><strong>completed</strong></em> or <em><strong>scheduled for release</strong></em>, and enter a <em>resolution</em>, which will be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolved</strong>: A problem was fixed.</li>
<li><strong>Implemented</strong>: A change or new feature which did not constitute a fault was successfully implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate</strong>: The issue had already been raised under a different support request.  In this case the engineer should make reference to the original request when closing the duplicate.</li>
<li><strong>Advice given</strong>: The engineer issued advice to the client but took no action.</li>
<li><strong>No action taken</strong>: Nothing was done, no advice given.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a request is in the completed state, it is then reviewed, either by the author or by another engineer, and may be <em><strong>closed</strong></em> if the reviewer is in agreement with the engineer that actioned the request.  Closed requests are stored indefinitely as a record of the incident.</p>
