		Currently there is no support contract associated with this project.  This may be because your support key has not yet been installed, or because you do not have a support contract with Assanka.  We offer four levels of packaged support, allowing you peace of mind in the event of a fault or network problem:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Standard:</b> 8 hour response, Monday to Friday.  This basic level of support is perfect for non-critical web applications such as company websites.</li>
		<li><b>Rapid:</b> 4 hour response, Monday to Saturday.  Faster support in fringe hours for businesses who place greater reliance on their web applications.</li>
		<li><b>24 Hour:</b> 4 hour response, 24 hours a day (excluding public holidays).  Round the clock support for round the clock business.</li>
		<li><b>Critical:</b> Expedited response, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  An instant and powerful response to faults of any kind - the ultimate peace of mind for critical systems.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To find out more about taking out a support package, get in touch with your account manager or call 0870 085 2038. </p>
