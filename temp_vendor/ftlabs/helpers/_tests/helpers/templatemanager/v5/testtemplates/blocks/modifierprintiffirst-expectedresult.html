This is some sample content to check that the "printiffirst" block modifier is working correctly.


	This is a singly output block.
	This should be output as it's the only "iteration".



	This is a loop-output block, iteration uno.
	
		This should only be output for the first iteration.
	

	This is a loop-output block, iteration dos.
	

	This is a loop-output block, iteration tres.
	

	This is a loop-output block, iteration quatro.
	



	And once more within another block, also using printiffirst syntax instead of iffirst:
	
		This is a loop-output block, iteration uno.
		
			This should only be output for the first iteration.
		
	
		This is a loop-output block, iteration dos.
		
	
		This is a loop-output block, iteration tres.
		
	
		This is a loop-output block, iteration quatro.
		
	


All done.
