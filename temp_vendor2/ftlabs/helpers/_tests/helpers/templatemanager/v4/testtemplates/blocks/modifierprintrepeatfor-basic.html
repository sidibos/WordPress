This is some sample content to check that the "repeatfor" block modifier is working correctly.
<!--@BLOCK:checkrepeat|repeatfor:testvar-->
This block shouldn't be repeated, nor should it be output, as the variable isn't set.
<!--@ENDBLOCK:checkrepeat-->

<!--@BLOCK:checkrepeat|repeatfor:testvar2-->
This block shouldn't be repeated, but it should be output once, as the variable is set as a single.
<!--@ENDBLOCK:checkrepeat-->

<!--@BLOCK:checkrepeat|repeatfor:testvar3-->
This block should be output four times (list).
<!--@ENDBLOCK:checkrepeat-->

<!--@BLOCK:checkrepeat|repeatfor:testvar4-->
This block should be output three times (collection).
<!--@ENDBLOCK:checkrepeat-->

<!--@BLOCK:checkrepeatouter|repeatfor:testvar5-->
This outer block should be output twice.
	<!--@BLOCK:checkrepeatinner|repeatfor:testvar6-->This inner block should be repeated six times in total.<!--@ENDBLOCK:checkrepeatinner-->
<!--@ENDBLOCK:checkrepeatouter-->

All done...
